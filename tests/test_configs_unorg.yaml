# Driver params
nb_packets_in_array_msg: 0 # Override for the number of packets per array (0 = automatically computed by driver based on FoV size)
organized_cloud: false # unorganized pointclouds allow for a smaller payload, organized pointcloud can be processed/converted to images

colormap_name: 'turbo' # color palette choice: turbo, inferno, viridis
color_by_reflectivity: false # point cloud coloring by reflectivity
range_min: 0.0 # meters, minimum range of a valid detection
range_max: 30.0 # meters, maximum range of a valid detection

min_brightness: 0.2 # enter a value in range [0., 1.0)
max_brightness: 10000.0 # this is the maximum value that the reflectivity can take. If this is too high, everything will appear dark
